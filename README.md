# plan-your-day

An Hourly Workday Planner

## Description

At the top of the page, you will find the application title as well as today's date.

The calendar below breaks the workday into hourly time blocks, and provides a place to store tasks, events, and notes within each block. Hours which have passed are colored gray, the current hour is red, and future hours are green.

## Usage

Click on a block to type in an item, and click the corresponding save button on the right side of the block to store what you entered. When you come back to the page, the items you've entered will remain there for your convenience. Check out the deployed page here:

Provided that the time is before 8am, the page will appear like so:

Between 2pm and 3pm, when you've entered several items, clicked save, and refreshed the page, the app might look like this:
